Description: Py3QTermWidget
        =============
        
        Unlike the older pyqonsole this console widget works with PyQt5/PySide2 and let's you
        embed a shell into your application. 
        
        See *docs/usage.rst* if you want to know how to use this widget. To test
        the widget you can execute *demo.py*.
        
        Or browse the generated HTML documentation at
        http://pyqtermwidget.rtfd.org/
        
        The vt100 terminal emulation code is based on AjaxTerm and WebShell.
